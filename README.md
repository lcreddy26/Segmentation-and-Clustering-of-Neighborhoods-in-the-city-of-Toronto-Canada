# Toronto-Segmentation-Assignment

In this assignment, we will explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information that is required to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. The data was scraped from the Wikipedia page and wrangled, cleaned, and then read into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format.

For scraping the data from the following website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M, I used Beautifulsoup and requests.
